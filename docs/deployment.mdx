description: 将Docusaurus应用部署到一系列静态站点托管服务上进行生产。
---

# 部署

要构建用于生产的网站的静态文件，请运行:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build
```

一旦完成，静态文件将在`build`目录中生成。

:::note

Docusaurus 的唯一职责是构建您的站点并在`构建`中生成静态文件。

现在由您来选择如何托管这些静态文件。

:::

你可以将你的站点部署到静态站点托管服务，如[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)， [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)， [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)， [Render](https://render.com/docs/static-sites)和[Surge](https://surge.sh/help/getting-started-with-surge)。

Docusaurus 站点是静态呈现的，它通常可以在没有 JavaScript 的情况下工作!

## 配置 {#configuration}

以下参数需要在`docusaurus.config.js`中优化路由并从正确的位置提供文件:

| Name      | Description                                                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`     | 您网站的 URL。对于部署在`https://my-org.com/my-project/`的站点，`url`是`https://my-org.com/`。          |
| `baseUrl` | 项目的基本 URL，带尾斜杠。对于部署在`https://my-org.com/my-project/`的站点，`baseUrl`是`/my-project/`。 |

## 本地测试构建 {#testing-build-locally}

在将构建部署到生产环境之前，对其进行本地测试非常重要。Docusaurus 提供了一个[`Docusaurus serve`](cli.mdx#docusaurus-serve-sitedir)命令:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run serve
```

默认情况下，这将加载您的网站[`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/).

## 尾斜线结构 {#trailing-slashes}

Docusaurus 有一个[`trailingSlash` 配置](./api/docusaurus.config.js.mdx#trailingSlash)来允许自定义 URLs/links 和发出的文件名模式。

默认值通常可以正常使用。不幸的是，每个静态托管提供商都有不同的行为，将完全相同的站点部署到不同的主机上可能会导致不同的结果。根据您的主机，更改此配置可能很有用。

:::tip

使用[slorber/trailing-slash-guide](https://github.com/slorber/trailing-slash-guide)来更好地理解你的主机的行为，并适当地配置`trailingSlash`。

:::

## 使用环境变量 {#using-environment-variables}

将潜在的敏感信息放在环境中是常见的做法。然而，在典型的 Docusaurus 网站中，`docusaurus.config.js`文件是与 Node.js 环境的唯一接口(参见[我们的架构概述](advanced/architecture.mdx))，而其他所有内容(MDX 页面，React 组件等)都是客户端，不能直接访问`process`全局变量。在这种情况下，您可以考虑使用[`customFields`](api/docusaurus.config.js.mdx#customFields)将环境变量传递到客户端。

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
// If you are using dotenv (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
require("dotenv").config();

module.exports = {
  title: "...",
  url: process.env.URL, // You can use environment variables to control site specifics as well
  // highlight-start
  customFields: {
    // Put your custom environment here
    teamEmail: process.env.EMAIL,
  },
  // highlight-end
};
```

```jsx title="home.jsx"
import useDocusaurusContext from "@docusaurus/useDocusaurusContext";

export default function Home() {
  const {
    siteConfig: { customFields },
  } = useDocusaurusContext();
  return <div>Contact us through {customFields.teamEmail}!</div>;
}
```

## 选择托管提供商 {#choosing-a-hosting-provider}

有几个常见的托管选项:

- [自我托管](#self-hosting) 使用 Apache2 或 Nginx 等 HTTP 服务器。
- Jamstack 提供者 (e.g. [Netlify](#deploying-to-netlify) 和 [Vercel](#deploying-to-vercel)). 我们将使用它们作为引用，但同样的推理也适用于其他提供者。
- [GitHub Pages](#deploying-to-github-pages) (根据定义，它也是 Jamstack，但我们分别对其进行比较).

如果你不确定选择哪一个，问以下问题:

<details>

<summary>我愿意为此投入多少资源(金钱、人力、时间等)?</summary>

- 🔴 自托管需要网络以及 Linux 和 web 服务器管理方面的经验。这是最困难的选择，需要花费最多的时间来成功管理。在费用方面，云服务几乎从来不是免费的，购买/部署本地服务器可能会更加昂贵。
- 🟢 Jamstack 提供商可以帮助你在几乎没有时间的情况下建立一个工作的网站，并提供像服务器端重定向这样的功能，这些功能很容易配置。许多提供商提供慷慨的构建时间配额，即使是免费计划，您也几乎永远不会超过。然而，免费计划是有限制的，一旦达到这些限制，你就需要付费。请查看供应商的定价页面以了解详细信息。
- 🟡 GitHub Pages 部署工作流程的设置可能很繁琐。 (证据: 看[部署到 GitHub Pages](#deploying-to-github-pages)的长度!) 但是，此服务(包括构建和部署)对于公共存储库始终是免费的，并且我们有详细的说明来帮助您使用它。

</details>

<details>

<summary>我需要多少服务器端定制?</summary>

- 🟢 使用自托管，您可以访问整个服务器的配置。您可以将虚拟主机配置为根据请求 URL 提供不同的内容，您可以进行复杂的服务器端重定向，您可以实现身份验证，等等。如果你需要很多服务器端功能，自己托管你的网站。
- 🟡 Jamstack 通常提供一些服务器端配置(例如 URL 格式化(尾斜杠)，服务器端重定向等)。
- 🔴 GitHub 页面不暴露服务器端配置除了强制 HTTPS 和设置 CNAME 记录。

</details>

<details>

<summary>我需要协作友好型部署工作流吗?</summary>

- 🟡 自托管服务可以利用像 Netlify 这样的持续部署功能，但涉及到更多的繁重工作。通常，您会指定一个特定的人来管理部署，并且与其他两个选项相反，工作流不会非常基于礼品。
- 🟢 Netlify 和 Vercel 对每个 pull 请求都有部署预览，这对于团队在合并到生产环境之前检查工作很有用。您还可以管理对部署具有不同成员访问权限的团队。
- 🟡 GitHub Pages 无法以非复杂的方式进行部署预览。一个 repo 只能与一个站点部署相关联。另一方面，您可以控制谁拥有对站点部署的写访问权。

</details>

没有什么灵丹妙药。在做出选择之前，你需要权衡你的需求和资源。

## 自托管 {#self-hosting}

Docusaurus 可以使用[`Docusaurus server`](cli.mdx#docusaurus-serve-sitedir)自托管。使用`--port` 和 `--host`更改端口。

```bash npm2yarn
npm run serve -- --build --port 80 --host 0.0.0.0
```

:::warning

与静态托管提供商/ CDN 相比，它不是最好的选择。

:::

:::warning

在下面的部分中，我们将介绍一些常见的托管提供商，以及如何配置它们以最有效地部署 Docusaurus 站点。Docusaurus 不隶属于任何这些服务，提供这些信息只是为了方便。一些文章是由第三方提供的，最近的 API 变化可能不会反映在我们这边。如果你看到过时的内容，pr 是受欢迎的。

因为我们只能在尽力而为的基础上提供这些内容，我们已经停止接受 pr 添加新的托管选项。但是，您可以在单独的网站(例如您的博客或提供商的官方网站)上发布您的书面陈述，并要求我们提供指向您的书面陈述的链接。

:::

## 部署到 Netlify {#deploying-to-netlify}

要将 Docusaurus 2 站点部署到[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)，首先确保正确配置以下选项:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // highlight-start
  url: "https://docusaurus-2.netlify.app", // Url to your site with no trailing slash
  baseUrl: "/", // Base directory of your site relative to your repo
  // highlight-end
  // ...
};
```

然后，[用 Netlify 创建你的网站](https://app.netlify.com/start)。

在设置站点时，按照如下方式指定构建命令和目录:

- 建造的命令: `npm run build`
- 发布目录: `build`

如果您没有配置这些构建选项，您仍然可以在创建站点后转到`站点设置`->`构建和部署`。

一旦正确配置了上述选项，您的站点应该部署并自动重新部署合并到您的部署分支，默认为`main`。

:::caution

一些 Docusaurus 网站将`docs`文件夹放在`website`之外(很可能是以前的 Docusaurus v1 网站):

```bash
repo           # git root
├── docs       # MD files
└── website    # Docusaurus root
```

如果你决定使用`website`文件夹作为 Netlify 的基本目录，当你更新`docs`文件夹时，Netlify 将不会触发构建，你需要配置一个[自定义`ignore`命令](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/common-configurations/ignore-builds/):)

```toml title="website/netlify.toml"
[build]
  ignore = "git diff --quiet $CACHED_COMMIT_REF $COMMIT_REF . ../docs/"
```

:::

:::warning

默认情况下，Netlify 会在 Docusaurus url 后面添加斜杠。

建议禁用 Netlify 设置`Post Processing > Asset Optimization > Pretty Urls`，以防止小写 url，不必要的重定向和 404 错误。

**要非常小心**:`Disable asset optimization`全局复选框是坏的，并没有真正禁用`Pretty URLs`设置在实践中。请确保**独立取消勾选**。

如果你想保持`Pretty URLs`Netlify 设置，调整`trailingSlash`Docusaurus 配置适当。

请参阅[slorber/trailing-slash-guide](https://github.com/slorber/trailing-slash-guide)了解更多信息。

:::

## 部署到 Vercel {#deploying-to-vercel}

将 Docusaurus 项目部署到[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)将在性能和易用性方面为您提供[各种好处](https://vercel.com/)。

要使用[Vercel for Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git)部署 Docusaurus 项目，请确保它已被推送到 Git 存储库。

使用[Import Flow](https://vercel.com/import/git)将项目导入 Vercel。在导入过程中，您将发现为您预先配置的所有相关选项;但是，您可以选择更改这些[选项](https://vercel.com/docs/build-step#build-&-development-settings)中的任何一个。

在您的项目被导入之后，所有后续的分支推送将生成[预览部署](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments#preview)，所有对[生产分支](https://vercel.com/docs/git-integrations#production-branch)所做的更改(通常是"main" 或 "master")将导致[生产部署](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments#production)。

## 部署到 GitHub 页面 {#deploying-to-github-pages}

Docusaurus provides an easy way to publish to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which comes free with every GitHub repository.

### 概述 {#github-pages-overview}

Usually, there are two repositories (at least two branches) involved in a publishing process: the branch containing the source files, and the branch containing the build output to be served with GitHub Pages. In the following tutorial, they will be referred to as **"source"** and **"deployment"**, respectively.

Each GitHub repository is associated with a GitHub Pages service. If the deployment repository is called `my-org/my-project` (where `my-org` is the organization name or username), the deployed site will appear at `https://my-org.github.io/my-project/`. If the deployment repository is called `my-org/my-org.github.io` (the _organization GitHub Pages repo_), the site will appear at `https://my-org.github.io/`.

:::info

In case you want to use your custom domain for GitHub Pages, create a `CNAME` file in the `static` directory. Anything within the `static` directory will be copied to the root of the `build` directory for deployment. When using a custom domain, you should be able to move back from `baseUrl: '/projectName/'` to `baseUrl: '/'`, and also set your `url` to your custom domain.

You may refer to GitHub Pages' documentation [User, Organization, and Project Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages) for more details.

:::

GitHub Pages picks up deploy-ready files (the output from `docusaurus build`) from the default branch (`master` / `main`, usually) or the `gh-pages` branch, and either from the root or the `/docs` folder. You can configure that through `Settings > Pages` in your repository. This branch will be called the "deployment branch".

We provide a `docusaurus deploy` command that helps you deploy your site from the source branch to the deployment branch in one command: clone, build, and commit.

### `docusaurus.config.js` settings {#docusaurusconfigjs-settings}

First, modify your `docusaurus.config.js` and add the following params:

| Name               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `organizationName` | The GitHub user or organization that owns the deployment repository.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `projectName`      | The name of the deployment repository.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `deploymentBranch` | The name of the deployment branch. It defaults to `'gh-pages'` for non-organization GitHub Pages repos (`projectName` not ending in `.github.io`). Otherwise, it needs to be explicit as a config field or environment variable. |

These fields also have their environment variable counterparts which have a higher priority: `ORGANIZATION_NAME`, `PROJECT_NAME`, and `DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH`.

:::caution

GitHub Pages adds a trailing slash to Docusaurus URLs by default. It is recommended to set a `trailingSlash` config (`true` or `false`, not `undefined`).

:::

例子:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  url: "https://endiliey.github.io", // Your website URL
  baseUrl: "/",
  // highlight-start
  projectName: "endiliey.github.io",
  organizationName: "endiliey",
  trailingSlash: false,
  // highlight-end
  // ...
};
```

:::warning

By default, GitHub Pages runs published files through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Since Jekyll will discard any files that begin with `_`, it is recommended that you disable Jekyll by adding an empty file named `.nojekyll` file to your `static` directory.

:::

### 环境设置 {#environment-settings}

| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USE_SSH`        | Set to `true` to use SSH instead of the default HTTPS for the connection to the GitHub repo. If the source repo URL is an SSH URL (e.g. `git@github.com:facebook/docusaurus.git`), `USE_SSH` is inferred to be `true`.                    |
| `GIT_USER`       | The username for a GitHub account that **has push access to the deployment repo**. For your own repositories, this will usually be your GitHub username. Required if not using SSH, and ignored otherwise.                                |
| `GIT_PASS`       | Personal access token of the git user (specified by `GIT_USER`), to facilitate non-interactive deployment (e.g. continuous deployment)                                                                                                    |
| `CURRENT_BRANCH` | The source branch. Usually, the branch will be `main` or `master`, but it could be any branch except for `gh-pages`. If nothing is set for this variable, then the current branch from which `docusaurus deploy` is invoked will be used. |
| `GIT_USER_NAME`  | The `git config user.name` value to use when pushing to the deployment repo                                                                                                                                                               |
| `GIT_USER_EMAIL` | The `git config user.email` value to use when pushing to the deployment repo                                                                                                                                                              |

GitHub enterprise installations should work in the same manner as github.com; you only need to set the organization's GitHub Enterprise host as an environment variable:

| Name          | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `GITHUB_HOST` | The domain name of your GitHub enterprise site. |
| `GITHUB_PORT` | The port of your GitHub enterprise site.        |

### 部署 {#deploy}

Finally, to deploy your site to GitHub Pages, run:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
```

```bash
GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME> yarn deploy
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
```

```batch
cmd /C "set "GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME>" && yarn deploy"
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell">
```

```powershell
cmd /C 'set "GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME>" && yarn deploy'
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

:::caution

Beginning in August 2021, GitHub requires every command-line sign-in to use the **personal access token** instead of the password. When GitHub prompts for your password, enter the PAT instead. See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for more information.

Alternatively, you can use SSH (`USE_SSH=true`) to log in.

### 使用 GitHub Actions 触发部署 {#triggering-deployment-with-github-actions}

[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) allow you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository.

The workflow examples below assume your website source resides in the `main` branch of your repository (the _source branch_ is `main`), and your [publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) is configured for the `gh-pages` branch (the _deployment branch_ is `gh-pages`).

Our goal is that:

1. When a new pull request is made to `main`, there's an action that ensures the site builds successfully, without actually deploying. This job will be called `test-deploy`.
2. When a pull request is merged to the `main` branch or someone pushes to the `main` branch directly, it will be built and deployed to the `gh-pages` branch. After that, the new build output will be served on the GitHub Pages site. This job will be called `deploy`.

Here are two approaches to deploying your docs with GitHub Actions. Based on the location of your deployment branch (`gh-pages`), choose the relevant tab below:

- Source repo and deployment repo are the **same** repository.
- The deployment repo is a **remote** repository, different from the source.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="same" label="Same">
```

While you can have both jobs defined in the same workflow file, the original `deploy` workflow will always be listed as skipped in the PR check suite status, which is not indicative of the actual status and provides no value to the review process. We therefore propose to manage them as separate workflows instead.

We will use a popular third-party deployment action: [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#%EF%B8%8F-docusaurus).

<details>
<summary>GitHub action files</summary>

Add these two workflow files:

:::warning Tweak the parameters for your setup

These files assume you are using Yarn. If you use npm, change `cache: yarn`, `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`, `yarn build` to `cache: npm`, `npm ci`, `npm run build` accordingly.

If your Docusaurus project is not at the root of your repo, you may need to configure a [default working directory](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-set-the-default-shell-and-working-directory), and adjust the paths accordingly.

A cross-repo publish is more difficult to set up because you need to push to another repo with permission checks. We will be using SSH to do the authentication.

1. Generate a new [SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent). Since this SSH key will be used in CI, make sure to not enter any passphrase.
2. By default, your public key should have been created in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`; otherwise, use the name you've provided in the previous step to add your key to [GitHub deploy keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/).
3. Copy the key to clipboard with `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and paste it as a [deploy key](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) in the deployment repository. Copy the file content if the command line doesn't work for you. Check the box for `Allow write access` before saving your deployment key.
4. You'll need your private key as a [GitHub secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) to allow Docusaurus to run the deployment for you.
5. Copy your private key with `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa` and paste a GitHub secret with the name `GH_PAGES_DEPLOY` on your source repository. Copy the file content if the command line doesn't work for you. Save your secret.
6. Create your [documentation workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file) in `.github/workflows/`. In this example it's `deploy.yml`.

At this point, you should have:

- the source repo with the GitHub workflow set with the private SSH key as the GitHub Secret, and
- your deployment repo set with the public SSH key in GitHub Deploy Keys.

<summary>Site not deployed properly?</summary>

After pushing to main, if you don't see your site published at the desired location (for example, it says "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here", or it's showing your repo's README.md file), try the following:

- Wait about three minutes and refresh. It may take a few minutes for GitHub pages to pick up the new files.
- Check your repo's landing page for a little green tick next to the last commit's title, indicating the CI has passed. If you see a cross, it means the build or deployment failed, and you should check the log for more debugging information.
- Click on the tick and make sure you see a "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow. Names like "pages build and deployment / deploy" are GitHub's default workflows, indicating your custom deployment workflow failed to be triggered at all. Make sure the YAML files are placed under the `.github/workflows` folder, and that the trigger condition is set correctly (e.g., if your default branch is "master" instead of "main", you need to change the `on.push` property).
- Under your repo's Settings > Pages, make sure the "Source" (which is the source for the _deployment_ files, not "source" as in our terminology) is set to "gh-pages" + "/ (root)", since we are using `gh-pages` as the deployment branch.

If you are using a custom domain:

- Verify that you have the correct DNS records set up if you're using a custom domain. See [GitHub pages documentation on configuring custom domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages). Also, please be aware that it may take up to 24 hours for DNS changes to propagate through the internet.

### 使用 Travis CI 触发部署 {#triggering-deployment-with-travis-ci}

Continuous integration (CI) services are typically used to perform routine tasks whenever new commits are checked in to source control. These tasks can be any combination of running unit tests and integration tests, automating builds, publishing packages to npm, and deploying changes to your website. All you need to do to automate the deployment of your website is to invoke the `yarn deploy` script whenever your website is updated. The following section covers how to do just that using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/), a popular continuous integration service provider.

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and generate a new [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/). When creating the token, grant it the `repo` scope so that it has the permissions it needs.
2. Using your GitHub account, [add the Travis CI app](https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci) to the repository you want to activate.
3. Open your Travis CI dashboard. The URL looks like `https://travis-ci.com/USERNAME/REPO`, and navigate to the `More options > Setting > Environment Variables` section of your repository.
4. Create a new environment variable named `GH_TOKEN` with your newly generated token as its value, then `GH_EMAIL` (your email address) and `GH_NAME` (your GitHub username).
5. Create a `.travis.yml` on the root of your repository with the following:

```yml title=".travis.yml"
language: node_js
node_js:
  - 18
branches:
  only:
    - main
cache:
  yarn: true
script:
  - git config --global user.name "${GH_NAME}"
  - git config --global user.email "${GH_EMAIL}"
  - echo "machine github.com login ${GH_NAME} password ${GH_TOKEN}" > ~/.netrc
  - yarn install
  - GIT_USER="${GH_NAME}" yarn deploy
```

Now, whenever a new commit lands in `main`, Travis CI will run your suite of tests and if everything passes, your website will be deployed via the `yarn deploy` script.

### 使用 Buddy 触发部署 {#triggering-deployment-with-buddy}

[Buddy](https://buddy.works/) is an easy-to-use CI/CD tool that allows you to automate the deployment of your portal to different environments, including GitHub Pages.

Follow these steps to create a pipeline that automatically deploys a new version of your website whenever you push changes to the selected branch of your project:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and generate a new [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/). When creating the token, grant it the `repo` scope so that it has the permissions it needs.
2. Sign in to your Buddy account and create a new project.
3. Choose GitHub as your git hosting provider and select the repository with the code of your website.
4. Using the left navigation panel, switch to the `Pipelines` view.
5. Create a new pipeline. Define its name, set the trigger mode to `On push`, and select the branch that triggers the pipeline execution.
6. Add a `Node.js` action.
7. Add these commands in the action's terminal:

```bash
GIT_USER=<GH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
git config --global user.email "<YOUR_GH_EMAIL>"
git config --global user.name "<YOUR_GH_USERNAME>"
yarn deploy
```

After creating this simple pipeline, each new commit pushed to the branch you selected deploys your website to GitHub Pages using `yarn deploy`. Read [this guide](https://buddy.works/guides/react-docusaurus) to learn more about setting up a CI/CD pipeline for Docusaurus.

### 使用 Azure 管道 {#using-azure-pipelines}

1. Sign Up at [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) if you haven't already.
2. Create an organization. Within the organization, create a project and connect your repository from GitHub.
3. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and generate a new [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) with the `repo` scope.
4. In the project page (which looks like `https://dev.azure.com/ORG_NAME/REPO_NAME/_build`), create a new pipeline with the following text. Also, click on edit and add a new environment variable named `GH_TOKEN` with your newly generated token as its value, then `GH_EMAIL` (your email address) and `GH_NAME` (your GitHub username). Make sure to mark them as secret. Alternatively, you can also add a file named `azure-pipelines.yml` at your repository root.

```yml title="azure-pipelines.yml"
trigger:
  - main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
  - checkout: self
    persistCredentials: true

  - task: NodeTool@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: "18"
    displayName: Install Node.js

  - script: |
      git config --global user.name "${GH_NAME}"
      git config --global user.email "${GH_EMAIL}"
      git checkout -b main
      echo "machine github.com login ${GH_NAME} password ${GH_TOKEN}" > ~/.netrc
      yarn install
      GIT_USER="${GH_NAME}" yarn deploy
    env:
      GH_NAME: $(GH_NAME)
      GH_EMAIL: $(GH_EMAIL)
      GH_TOKEN: $(GH_TOKEN)
    displayName: Install and build
```

### 使用 Drone {#using-drone}

1. Create a new SSH key that will be the [deploy key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys) for your project.
2. Name your private and public keys to be specific and so that it does not overwrite your other [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
3. Go to `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/settings/keys` and add a new deploy key by pasting in the public key you just generated.
4. Open your Drone.io dashboard and log in. The URL looks like `https://cloud.drone.io/USERNAME/REPO`.
5. Click on the repository, click on activate repository, and add a secret called `git_deploy_private_key` with your private key value that you just generated.
6. Create a `.drone.yml` on the root of your repository with the below text.

```yml title=".drone.yml"
kind: pipeline
type: docker
trigger:
  event:
    - tag
- name: Website
  image: node
  commands:
    - mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
    - ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts
    - echo "$GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY" > "$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa"
    - chmod 0600 $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
    - cd website
    - yarn install
    - yarn deploy
  environment:
    USE_SSH: true
    GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY:
      from_secret: git_deploy_private_key
```

Now, whenever you push a new tag to GitHub, this trigger will start the drone CI job to publish your website.
