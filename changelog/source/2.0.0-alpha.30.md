# 2.0.0-alpha.30

<!-- truncate -->

- Fix babel transpilation include/exclude logic to be more efficient. This also fix a very weird bug `TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'exports' of object '#<Object>'`.([#1868](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/1868))

If you are still encountering the error. Please check whether you use `module.exports` for your `.js` file instead of doing `export` (mixing CJS and ES). See https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/4039#issuecomment-477779322 and https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/4039#issuecomment-273804003 for more context.
