# 2.0.0-alpha.33

<!-- truncate -->

## Features

- Table of contents is now highlighted depending on current active headings. (thanks to awesome @SantiagoGdaR) [#1896](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/1896)
- Official blog plugin can now generate feed for blog posts. (thanks to awesome @moozzyk) [#1916](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/1916)
- **BREAKING** `prismTheme` is renamed to `theme` as part new `prism` object in `themeConfig` field in your `docusaurus.config.js`. Eg:
  ```diff
   themeConfig: {
  -   prismTheme: require('prism-react-renderer/themes/dracula'),
  +   prism: {
  +     theme: require('prism-react-renderer/themes/dracula'),
  +   },
  },
  ```
- Added new `prism` option `defaultLanguage` that is used if the language is not specified in code blocks. [#1910](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/1910)

## Fixes

- Fix babel/env not picking the correct browserslist configuration during development. When running `docusaurus start`, `process.env.NODE_ENV` is now consistently set to `development`.
- Ensure routes config generation to be more consistent in ordering. Nested routes should be placed last in routes.js. This will allow user to create `src/pages/docs.js` to create custom docs page for `/docs` or even `src/pages/docs/super.js` to create page for `/docs/super/`;
- Fix watcher does not trigger reload on windows.
- Fix build compilation error if exists only one code tab.
- Add minor padding to docs container so that hash-link won't be cut off.

## Others

- Misc dependency upgrades.
- Stability improvement (more tests) & refactoring on docs plugin to prevent regression.
