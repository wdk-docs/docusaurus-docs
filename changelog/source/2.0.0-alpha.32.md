# 2.0.0-alpha.32

<!-- truncate -->

## Features

- Add `<Redirect>` component for client side redirect. Example Usage:

```js
import React from 'react';
import {Redirect} from '@docusaurus/router';

function Home() {
  return <Redirect to="/docs/test" />;
}
```

- Allow user to add custom HTML to footer items. [#1905](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/1905)
- Added code block line highlighting feature (thanks @lex111)! If you have previously swizzled the `CodeBlock` theme component, it is recommended to update your source code to have this feature. ([#1860](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/1860))

## Bug Fixes

- Fix `@theme/Tabs` component to be able to create tabs with only one item.
- Fix MDX `@theme/Heading` component. If there is no id, it should not create anchor link.
- Fixed a bug in which if `themeConfig.algolia` is not defined, the custom searchbar won't appear. If you've swizzled Algolia `SearchBar` component before, please update your source code otherwise CSS might break. See [#1909](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/1909/files) for reference.

```js
- <Fragment>
+ <div className="navbar__search" key="search-box">
```

- Slightly adjust search icon position to be more aligned on small width device. ([#1893](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/1893))
- Fix algolia styling bug, previously search suggestion result is sometimes hidden. ([#1915](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/1915))
- Changed the way we read the `USE_SSH` env variable during deployment to be the same as in v1.
- Fix accessing `docs/` or `/docs/xxxx` that does not match any existing doc page should return 404 (Not found) page, not blank page. ([#1903](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/1903))
- Prioritize `@docusaurus/core` dependencies/ node_modules over user's node_modules. This fix a bug whereby if user has core-js@3 on its own node_modules but docusaurus depends on core-js@2, we previously encounter `Module not found: core-js/modules/xxxx` (because core-js@3 doesn't have that).
- Fix a bug where docs plugin add `/docs` route even if docs folder is empty. We also improved docs plugin test coverage to 100% for stability before working on docs versioning. ([#1912](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/1912))

## Performance Improvement

- Reduce memory usage consumption. ([#1900](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/1900))
- Significantly reduce main bundle size and initial HTML payload on production build. Generated files from webpack is also shorter in name. ([#1898](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/1898))
- Simplify blog metadata. Previously, accessing `/blog/post-xxx` will request for next and prev blog post metadata too aside from target post metadata. We should only request target post metadata. ([#1908](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/1908))

## Others

- Convert sitemap plugin to TypeScript. ([#1894](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/1894))
- Refactor dark mode toggle into a hook. ([#1899](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/1899))
